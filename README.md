## Week 3 Independent project in class
# _Routing with Databases in Ruby_
### This application was built out with the spec files already written. Meaning I had access to the tests, and built the code to pass each test. The application will track projects and the volunteers working on them. Each volunteer will belong to only one project (one project, many volunteers).This is an Independent ptoject done while at Epicodus. It will deploy to heroku using Ruby and sinatra. 1.10.2019
